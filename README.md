# Hi there, I'm Ebrar 👋

Electrical and Electronics Engineer  
**Product Development • Configuration Management • Business Analyst**  
Agent-Based Artificial Intelligence • Technical Architecture • Engineering Systems

I work at the intersection of business needs, product development, and engineering systems;  
designing scalable architectures and agent-based AI workflows that transform complex requirements into reliable solutions.

## 🚀 The Thing I Do Best

- 📊 **Business Analysis and Requirements Engineering**  
  Transforming business needs into clear, testable, and traceable technical requirements  
  (PRD / FRD / use cases).

- 🧩 **Configuration Management and Systems Thinking**  
  Managing product structures, configuration logic, change impact, and lifecycle consistency  
  with engineering discipline.

- 🏗️ **Product and Technical Architecture**  
  Designing end-to-end system architectures that align product vision with robust technical  
  implementation.

- 🤖 **Agent-Based AI Orchestration**  
  Building multi-agent systems using LangChain and LangGraph to automate complex  
  decision-making and workflows.
